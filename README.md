# React Use State Examples 2

This is a companion project to my post [Understanding useState in React]() and my [upcoming LogRocket Meetup talk](https://blog.logrocket.com/understanding-usestate-in-react/) on the same topic.

The project showcases the `useState` hook and has three different components:

1. <Counter /> showcases a simple counter component that updates a value when clicked
2. <Single /> showcases a text field that updates a title value
3. <Multiple /> showcases event handlers and a typical pattern for handling local updates to arrays with a classic "to-do" example
